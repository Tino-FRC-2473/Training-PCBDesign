# PCB Design Training

This is a set of lessons introducing basic PCB design using KiCad. We will be making a fun design that blinks LEDs using basic components.

## Setup

KiCad is a free and open source PCB design software. Download and install KiCad from the website: [https://www.kicad.org/download/](https://www.kicad.org/download/).

Next, create a copy of the starter project in this repo.
1. Open KiCad
2. Select File->Clone project from repository
3. Enter Location: `https://github.com/Tino-FRC-2473/Training-PCBDesign.git`
4. Click OK
5. Select a folder to save the project
